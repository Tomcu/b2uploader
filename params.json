{"name":"B2uploader","tagline":"B2Uploader - Upload directories to B2","body":"# b2uploader\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nB2Uploader is a Console app (tested on Windows, may work with Mono or .NET Core on Linux and Mac... need to do some testing) which allows you to upload a folder to [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html). \r\n\r\n##How do i use it?\r\n\r\nGet the source and build in Visual Studio (2013 and 2015 should work). using cmd line, go to the build folder and run a command as follows:\r\n\r\nb2uploader --i <account id> --a <app key> --d <directory to upload>\r\n\r\nwhere account id and app key are gotten from BackBlaze's site, and the directory is the folder you want uploaded\r\n\r\n##Known issues\r\n\r\n* very little logging or details of what is going on\r\n* no error handing (currently crashes with VERY large files and multithreading).\r\n* probably a lot of other stuff... leave issues please!\r\n\r\n\r\n##What have i used it for?\r\n\r\nThe app uses multiple threads to do uploads. I am running on a machine in the house with 2 8 core Xeons and 64Gb ram. With this, it kicks of something like 64 threads (the test folder only had 48 files, so all started uploading immediatly!). \r\n","google":"UA-220614-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
